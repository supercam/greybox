# Dynamic Distribution Lists in Office 365:

This project is about creating dynamic distribution lists in O365.

Use Case:
Organization had contractors that needed to be placed into teams that could be seen by managers.  This led to a many bottlenecks in operations such as:

* Slow/Delayed Onboarding.
* Manual creation of groups.
* Poor communication between teams due to users not being in proper groups.

It was not practical to build distribution groups by hand in Office 365 admin console so the decision was made to automate and create dynamic distribution groups that use an attribute from the users profile to be automatically placed into a dynamic group.

Project was completed and initial deployment had went out to 24 groups consisting of over 4000 contractors.


Lessons Learned:

* It is important to make sure attributes are consistent.
* Automating those lists is scalable for the organization and is now used by default by onboarding team.
