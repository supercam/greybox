# Building an MDF/IDF:

This project is a summary of 2 projects.  A startup I worked at moved to a new corporate office and an IDF had to be built.  Later on the company was bought and the parent company leased part of their buidling for the company to use which needed an MDF and IDF built.

Use Case:

Organization needed to build an IDF for HQ so employees could work out of HQ office.


I contributed to the following:

 * Procurement of equipment.
 * Racking and stacking of equipment in the IDF.
 * Negotiating with the vendor to lower pricing of equipment.

2nd Project Use Case:

Organization needed to build an MDF and IDF's in order for employees to attend classes on-site

For this project there were multiple floors, so it involed building an MDF, and an IDF on another floor.

I contributed to the following:

 * Procurement of equipment for MDF/IDF.
 * Procurement of Monitors to be used at desks for employees.
 * Racking and stacking of equipment in the IDF.
 * Negotiating with the vendor to lower pricing of equipment.
 * Setting up desks on certain floors so employees could use computers at desks.

Lessons Learned:

* Planning for these projects takes a lot of oversight.
* Keep Stakeholders posted on project status.
