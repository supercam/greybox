# Supercam Labs

This is meant to be a technical documentation hub for all the projects I have worked on in IT.  This was created to provide additional information that would not be available on my resume.  This page also demonstrates the understanding of a simple CI/CD pipeline for technical documentation.

- Projects are laid out in two ways:
	* Summarized under [Project Summary](https://supercam.github.io/greybox/projects/ "Project Summary").
	* One-page briefs are under Professional Project One-Pagers and Personal Projects.
	* [PowerShell](https://github.com/supercam/greybox/tree/main/homelab_platform/powershell/operations_Prod "PowerShell") scripts are on GitHub.
	* [Python](https://github.com/supercam/greybox/tree/main/homelab_platform/python/pyProd "Python") scripts are on GitHub.
