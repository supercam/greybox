# Supercam Labs

Hello, Thank you for visiting this page.  This is meant to be a technical documentation hub for all the projects I have worked on in IT.  This was created to provide additional information that would not be avaiable on my resume.  This page also demonstrates the understanding of a simple CI/CD pipeline for technical documentation.

[GitHub Repo](http://github.com/supercam/greybox "GitHub")

- Projects are laid out in two ways:
	* Summarized under [Project Summary](https://supercam.github.io/greybox/projects/ "Project Summary").
	* One-pager briefs under Professional Project One-Pagers and Personal Projects.
	* [PowerShell](https://github.com/supercam/greybox/tree/c1570cdc4630352845ab886bfe1f873d34bb1f4a/homelab_platform/powershell "PowerShell") scripts are directly listed on GitHub.
